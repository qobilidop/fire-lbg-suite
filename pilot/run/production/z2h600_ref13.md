# Notes for z2h600_ref13

This simulation is run on [Bridges](https://www.psc.edu/bridges) from 2018-04-10 to 2018-05-28.

MPI tasks = 448

2. Benchmark results show that 2 OMP threads work more efficiently. 4 threads were used mainly because the previous z2h350_ref13 run encountered memory issues at late time, requiring increasing the number of threads. Here we could move on with 2 threads to save SUs and change back to 4 threads when it's necessary.
